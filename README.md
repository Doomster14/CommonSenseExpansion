# Common Sense Expansion
![](/About/Preview.png)

Like the well-known "Common Sense" mod, this mod fixes broken game mechanics and bugs, hence its name. Both mods can function independently.

**Features**
- Sown plants are not cut down when a growing zone is switched to a different plant.
- The "Allow cutting" toggle in growing zones only affects sowing. This complements the process of switching to a new plant in the zone. In the original game, only the designated plant can be harvested when cutting is disabled.
- Fix bug: Malnutrition ailment doesn't affect hunger rate.
